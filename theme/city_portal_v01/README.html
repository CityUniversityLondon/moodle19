<h3>CITY PORTAL THEME (VERSION 1.1)</h3>
<hr />

<p>This theme is based on Moodle Standard theme and styled to match new City portal theme. It was created by Mike Hughes January 2010.</p>

<p>All styles are in one file: styles_master.css with additional styles in print.css</p>

<p>By default, standard styles are automatically loaded before any other
themes, so that all custom themes need to do is to define their
own styles to augment or overwrite particular standard styles.</p>

<p>In this way custom themes are not "left behind" by Moodle upgrades.</p>
