<h3>CITY PORTAL THEME (VERSION 2.0)</h3>
<hr>
<p>Based on the bundled Formal White theme, this is a fixed width theme inspired by Facebook.</p>

<p>This theme is designed to emulate the 'look and feel' of the City Univeristy NextWeb project. Designed by Bill Rafferty June 2010.</p>

<p>By default, standard styles are automatically loaded before any other themes, so that all custom themes need to do is to define their own styles to augment or overwrite particular standard styles. In this way custom themes are not "left behind" by Moodle upgrades.</p>
