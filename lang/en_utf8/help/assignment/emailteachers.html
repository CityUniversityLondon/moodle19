<h1>Email alerts to teachers</h1>
<!-- CMDL-1629 Additional option to send email confirmation for late assignment submissions (REQ0033173) -->
<p>If 'All submissions' is enabled, then teachers are alerted with a short email whenever students
   add or update an assignment submission. If 'Late submissions' is enabled then teachers
   only recieve an email alert whenever students
   add or update an assignment submission AFTER the due date.
</p>
<!-- end CMDL-1629 -->
<p>Only teachers who are able to grade the particular submission are notified.
   So, for example, if the course uses separate groups, then teachers restricted
   to particular groups won't receive any notices about students in other groups.</p>

<p>For offline activities, of course, mail is never sent since students never 
   submit anything.</p>
