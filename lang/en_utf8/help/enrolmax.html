<h1>Maximum number of enrolled students</h1>

<p>This setting specifies the maximum number of students
   that are allowed to be enrolled on the course.</p>

<p>The number of available places will be displayed when a student
   tries to enrol on a course.</p>

<p>When the number of students on a course reaches the
   maximum limit, no student will be able to enrol on a course
   (although an administrator will be able to assign a student).</p>

<p>Note that if the maximum number of students is zero,
   there is no limit.</p>
