<h1>Allow scheduled backups</h1>

<p>By default this is set to Yes i.e. a course is set to be included in scheduled backups (currently daily).</p> 

<p>Set this to No if the course is no longer required to be backed up. This might be if it is no longer in use i.e. is from a previous academic year, or it is a read-only course and a backup already exists.
By turning off backups for such courses you will help make Moodle run more efficiently and save on storage space.</p>
