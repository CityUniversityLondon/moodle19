<h1>How to use Global Search</h1>

<p>This search tool searches content in courses you are enroled on, including web pages, PDFs and Word documents.</p>

<p>Full-text searching supports a number of options, listed below.  You can combine
   these to specify your search more precisely.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>search for these words</strong></td>
<td>For basic searching of one or more words anywhere in the texts, just type them separated by spaces. All words longer than two characters are used.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>+search +for these words</strong></td>
<td>The previous example would also match "information" because it contains "for". To force exact matching of a word, use the plus sign.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>+search -engine</strong></td>
<td>Use the minus sign if there are particular exact words you don't want included in the search.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>"search engine"</strong></td>
<td>To search for a particular phrase, use double quotes around it.</td>
</tr>


</table>

<p>For advanced searching, press the search button without typing anything in the words field - you will see
   a complete form that makes it easier to do advanced searches.</p>
