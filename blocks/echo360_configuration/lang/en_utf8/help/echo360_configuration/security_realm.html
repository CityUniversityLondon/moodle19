Two non-instructor users with the same user name and different realms will be considered different users by the EchoSystem.  If you are only using one method of authentication to the EchoSystem, then realm can have any arbitrary value. If you are using  multiple authentication providers (such as a seamless tool, and LDAP), but the same user name represents the same individual across authentication providers, then you should use the same realm for all authentication providers.
