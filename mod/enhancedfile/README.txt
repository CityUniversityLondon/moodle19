What does the enhanced file module do?
======================================

The enhanced file module wraps the standard Moodle mod/resource/file resource module.
However, it is much easier to use and facilitates multiple uploads in one session with a javascript / flash multi file select browse button - YES, you read that correctly - you can select multiple files and upload them in one go! (providing the web browser has Flash 9+ installed).
For browsers with javascript disabled or without Flash, the module will degrade gracefully to show a standard HTML4 file browser.

Future versions will use the HTML 5 fileapi (currently a W3C HTML5 draft spec)
